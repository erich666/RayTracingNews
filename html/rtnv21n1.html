First off, the RT News has joined the 20th century; just one more century to
go. If you want to sign up to get a notice when the Ray Tracing News is out,
you can now go to <A HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/ray-tracing-news">http://groups.google.com/group/ray-tracing-news</A> and add

This has been a busy year for me. We finished a 3rd edition of &quot;Real-Time
Rendering&quot; - now with 50% more ray tracing. Well, not really; the focus is
still rasterization. Part of the new edition work was revamping the website.
One good thing that came out of this was starting a blog:
<A HREF="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog">http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog</A>. I've thought of having a blog for my
thoughts on ray tracing and just do away with the RT News, but for now the
format of a digest works fine for what I want to do. Namely, record
interesting bits of information that might still be useful a few years down
the road. A blog's better for rasterization, which continues to rapidly
evolve due to qualitative changes in the GPUs. Well, true too for GPU ray
tracers, but I don't have as strong an interest in this area (other than to
admire others' work).
<P>
I spent a fair bit of my free time during the summer prepping for a keynote,
&quot;Ray Tracing: Strengths and Opportunities&quot;, at the IRT 2008 symposium,
<A HREF="http://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/">http://www.sci.utah.edu/rt08/</A>. The talk can be found here:
<A HREF="http://erich.realtimerendering.com/">http://erich.realtimerendering.com/</A>, but won't be half as good without the
jokes, and won't make a lot of sense without more notes. I talk more about
this problem of &quot;here are the slides for my talk&quot; at:
<A HREF="http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/rt08-presentation/">http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/rt08-presentation/</A>. The gist is that
most slidesets today are too wordy for the presentation itself, but not wordy
enough for those who missed the talk but download the slideset later.
<P>
My talk's probably most significant for showing the dangers of ray tracing;
see the slides near the very end. Chris Wyman tells me the same thing
happened to him, burning a mark in a table. But wait, there's more! Here's an
incredibly silly thing, with phat beats:
<A HREF="http://animoto.com/play/ISVnBQw7k1EN1aG9uovIXQ">http://animoto.com/play/ISVnBQw7k1EN1aG9uovIXQ</A> - I do like that the service
autogenerated this presentation. You can do this with any of your own works.
<P>
IRT 2008 itself was entirely great. You can find links for the papers at
<A HREF="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2008Papers.htm">http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2008Papers.htm</A> (previous conferences
here: <A HREF="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/">http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/</A>). Michael McCool led off with his
keynote, which had some solid technical content, including a scheme where you
map your objects to a Hilbert curve, sort by this order, then &quot;read off&quot; a
BVH from the sorted list. I hadn't seen this idea applied to ray tracing
before.
<P>
One general theme of the conference was using SIMD and/or packets
effectively, the Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) was everywhere, and animated
objects created interesting challenges for fast intersection. I was happy to
see work on improving the efficiency of various types of hierarchies. I'll
talk more about BVH later in this issue. One nice non-BVH result was Thiago
Ize et alia's BSP work, in which using a BSP tree where the planes can be
freely oriented was found to be more efficient for rendering. The hard part,
of course, is forming such a hierarchy, but if you're allowed lots of
precompute time then it's impressively effective. This issue's &quot;Two New Ways&quot;
article touches on two other papers presented. Lagae and Dutr&eacute; had a poster
(and CGF paper) on storing grid acceleration structures in various compact
data structures: <A HREF="http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~ares/">http://www.cs.kuleuven.be/~ares/</A>. There was plenty of other
interesting work, and it's great to see this burst of new research in various
ray-tracing-related fields (see Pete's article for some interesting stats in
this regard).
<P>
SIGGRAPH 2008 was hopping, as usual, though having IRT just before it made
for a long week. The coolest ray tracing related thing I saw was the CUDA ray
tracer by NVIDIA; see the article in this issue. Quick news summary here:
<A HREF="http://hothardware.com/News/NVIDIA-Shows-Interactive-Ray-Tracing-on-GPUs/">http://hothardware.com/News/NVIDIA-Shows-Interactive-Ray-Tracing-on-GPUs/</A>. It
was cool to see this running on the show floor, zooming along. Other ray
tracing bits at SIGGRAPH are listed here:

<P>
There's been an incredible amount of &quot;ray tracing vs. rasterization&quot; talk
over the past year. Rather than being a real argument, I believe this sort of
discussion reflects a yearning to be able to perform &quot;unrestricted&quot;
programming again (not limited by simplistic data structures in the form of a
few buffers). I was collecting these in anticipation of my talk. Phil Taylor
has a good summary of some other articles here:

There are other odd bits out in the datasphere. Witness JulesWorld,
<A HREF="http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/38145/135/">http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/38145/135/</A>, which had hype galore, some

that my AMD contacts didn't really know about (despite their company being

<P>
Finally, it's been interesting to watch &quot;acquisitions as ways to hire people&quot;
in the rendering world this past year or so: Neoptica acquired by Intel and
put to work on Larrabee, RayScale bought by NVIDIA. There have been larger
acquisitions, too: Opticore bought by Autodesk in June 2007, mental images
became a wholly-owned subsidiary of NVIDIA in Dec. 2007, and Autodesk buying
SoftImage just a few days ago (youtube video making the rounds:
<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR7UWImpG54">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR7UWImpG54</A>). I'm sure there are others that
haven't shown up on my radar - feel free to clue me in.

Last year during RT07 I more or less promised to provide the research
community with some student art to use in RTRT research. Well, I finally have
some stuff to share: My students released 'Outbound', a Myst-like game based
on Arauna, which uses a ~1M polygon scene, completely hand-made, and built to
demonstrate ray tracing. The data is available from my site
(<A HREF="http://igad.nhtv.nl/~bikker">http://igad.nhtv.nl/~bikker</A>) and comes with original textures and scenery
data in several file formats.
<P>
In the meantime, a second team is working on a very interesting game right
now, also based on Arauna. This game is an action game, and they strive for
higher FPS. The art they are building is low-poly (~50k per room, optimized
for ray tracing performance). It will be released somewhere after RT08 (again
including full set of art).

I've been wrapping my head around Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB).
I've seen a number of researchers mention using these in their ray tracing

too. Page here:

Puzzle Answer: Plane Intersection with Spheres vs. Boxes</A></FONT>, by Eric Haines
</H4>
The puzzle from last issue was: what is the relative probability of a random
plane hitting a sphere of radius R vs. hitting a box with edge lengths of
DxWxH? That is, given a random plane, sphere, and box, what is the relative
chance the plane hits the sphere vs. hitting the box? We know that for a
random ray, the chance is proportional to the surface area of each object;
this is the well-known Surface Area Heuristic (SAH).
<P>
A chance for a sphere to get hit by a plane is directly proportional to its
diameter. The &quot;mean width&quot; for a sphere is the same for all orientations of
the plane, and a sphere twice as wide is twice as likely to be hit.
<P>
I also gave, as background, the formula for the relative probability of plane
and box. It turns out that simply summing the dimensions of the box is its
relative probability of being hit. So a box that is 1x1x1 has a relative
probability of 3, one that is 2x4x6 gives 12, so is four times more likely to
be hit by a random plane. A surprising (to me) result, but this is a given.
<P>
So, what is the probability of a sphere relative to a box vs. the random
plane? This question can be solved by determining the true mean width of the
box. That is, if you randomly oriented the cube a zillion times and measured
how much of a fixed axis each covered when projected on it, i.e., what the
furthest extents were along that axis for each orientation, the average of
these measures would be the mean width with respect to the sphere's measure
of mean width.
<P>
It's clear that a sphere contained by a box must have a lower mean-width, so
a sphere of diameter 1, fitting in a cubic box of 1x1x1, has a lower chance
of being hit. A sphere encompassing the cubic box must have a higher chance,
i.e., one with a diameter of sqrt(3) vs. the box's 1x1x1 as a probability. So
the sphere to box conversion ratio must be between 1.0 and 1.732. That is,
some sphere of diameter between 1 and 1.732 must have the same chance of
getting hit as a box of size 1x1x1. To beat this to death, this is the same
as saying that the mean width of the 1x1x1 box must be in this range. At
first I tried directly working on what the average width is for this cube,
but it was a bit tricky to feel confident I was catching the full projection
of all orientations.
<P>
So I took a different approach. The first insight helped simplify the
problem. Instead of a 1x1x1 box, consider a 1x0x0 box, essentially a needle.
The relative chance of a plane hitting this needle is 1+0+0 = 1, vs. the
cubic box's 1+1+1 = 3 chance. If the needle is perpendicular to the plane,
its mean width is 1.0; if parallel, 0.0. The main question is then, what is
the mean width of this needle when arbitrarily oriented? Centering the needle
on the origin and then arbitrarily orienting this needle forms a sphere of
points from the needle's endpoints; this operation is equivalent to holding
the needle still and changing the orientation of the plane randomly. All
points are equally likely on the sphere, since all orientations have the same
chance. What we now want to know is what is the average Z height of the set
of endpoints; in other words, what is the average height above the plane of
the set of points on a hemisphere? This will equal half the mean width of the
needle.
<P>
Imagine you take a sphere and encompass it with a tight-fitting cylinder, its
height equal to the diameter. The surface area of the cylinder and sphere are
the same, 4*pi*r^2. With the cylinder being vertical, it turns out that if
you slice the cylinder and sphere at any height with a horizontal plane, the
surface area of the part of the sphere above the plane is equal to that of
the cylinder above the plane (and, of course, both parts' areas below also
match). Archimedes proved this (way before calculus) and the fact so
delighted and amazed him that he had a sphere and cylinder put on his
tombstone. See <A HREF="http://www.mathpages.com/HOME/kmath343.htm">http://www.mathpages.com/HOME/kmath343.htm</A> for more
information.
<P>
How does this apply? The surface area of any slice of the sphere is equal to
any other slice of the same thickness. For example, a slice for heights
[0.2,0.3] has the same surface area as from [0.83,0.93]. Once you accept that
the sphere and cylinder are equivalent in this way, along the axis of the
cylinder, you notice that the density of points on the sphere as a function
of height is a constant number, since the cylinder's area is obviously
constant with height. The answer is then clear: the average height (above the
origin) of a cylinder on a plane is half the height of the cylinder, which
therefore is the average height of a point on a (hemi)sphere. I'm sure you
could write a double integral to prove this (and I'm sure I could do this
back in 12th grade), but I like that you don't really need to do so.
<P>
Now we have all the pieces. A needle of length of 1 has a mean width of 0.5,
compared to a sphere having a mean width of 1.0. The box 1x1x1 is 3 times
more likely to be hit by a random plane than the needle, so it must have,
compared to the sphere of diameter 1.0, a mean width of 1.5. So the final
answer is that a box of DxWxH has a mean width of (DxWxH)/2 compared to a
sphere's mean width of 2*Radius. Simple, but I couldn't find this written
down anywhere in the Discrete Differential Geometry material I could find,
nor could I find anyone in the field who knew the answer. In fact, this
writeup is a bit incorrect in terminology in terms of that field: in that
field, the &quot;mean width&quot; of a 1x1x1 box is 3, the sum of the edges, when in
fact the &quot;geometric mean width&quot;, the width you would observe if you did
measurements of the arbitrarily-oriented box, is half of that. However,
&quot;geometric mean width&quot; is my own term - it's one that makes sense to me, but
isn't used this way in the field.

Puzzle: Triangle/Bounding Box Ratio</A></FONT>, by Eric Haines
</H4>
So here's a puzzle for next issue: given an arbitrarily-oriented equilateral
triangle, what is the ratio of the area of the triangle vs. the average
surface area of its axis-aligned bounding box? In other words, what is the
chance that a ray hitting a triangle's bounding box will actually hit the
triangle? For an oriented bounding box tightly fitting around the equilateral
triangle (or any triangle, for that matter), the ratio is 1/2, since the
bounding box can be a rectangle around the triangle and so is twice its area.
So we know the answer is lower than that, since axis-aligned boxes don't
bound arbitrary triangles tightly. I don't have an answer - don't make me
solve it! Even the upper bound (worst orientation for an equilateral
triangle) is not obvious to me, and is a good little problem to contemplate.
If you can figure these out, is there a general formula for the average and
worst ratios for any given triangle?

Terminology for Ray Tracing</A></FONT>, by Peter Shirley (shirley(at)cs(.)utah(.)edu)
</H4>
[Pete put a poster along these lines up at RT 2008, asking for comments. This
is a revision of his proposal. More comments, please! I have my own opinions,
but I'd like to hear from other people first. Please write Pete direct and
cc: me. -- Eric]
<P>
Ray tracing has been an active area of computer graphics research for about
three decades. While somewhat quiet in the 1990s, ray tracing has seen
resurgence in the last few years. According to google's scholar database,
Whitted's classic paper received more citations in 2007 than in any previous
year. This is in spite of the decreasing likelihood of citations to Whitted's
paper within modern ray tracing papers; only one in six of the papers in the
2008 Symposium on Interactive Ray Tracing (RT08) cited that paper. In
response to this renewed interest I presented a poster at RT08 titled &quot;A
Proposal for Terminology Related to Ray Tracing&quot;. This was a reaction to all
the scar tissue I developed over terminology in global illumination where we
too late got our act together as a community in getting a sensible and
consistent set of terms. Even now, there is no standard definition for what a
&quot;radiosity&quot; method is. I would include a photon-tracer that writes
irradiances to texture, while some others would assume any radiosity program
uses a finite element method. As ray tracing is now making a comeback, I'd
like to build some consensus on terms to lower confusion as we discuss ray
tracing. I include an edited version of the poster abstract here, along with
some outstanding issues I hope people will weigh in on. I considered forming
an ad hoc working group, but decided maximizing latency was a bad idea given
the current popularity of ray tracing.
<P>
DEPRECATED TERMS
<P>
The following terms should be avoided:
<P>
Secondary Ray. Some authors include shadow rays in the definition of
secondary rays. Others exclude shadow rays. The common use of &quot;primary&quot; and
&quot;secondary&quot; do not suggest a resolution of this ambiguity.
<P>
Primary Ray. One might assume that a ray that is not &quot;secondary&quot; is
&quot;primary&quot;. However, authors that do not call shadow rays secondary do not
typically consider them primary either. Given that and the ambiguity in
&quot;secondary&quot;, &quot;primary&quot; should be deprecated. Some people at RT08 argued that
&quot;non-viewing&quot; rays should have its own name. On further thought I disagree
with that, as non-viewing rays vary so much among themselves in both what
they are used for as well as their computational characteristics.
<P>
Global Illumination. For a decade &quot;global illumination&quot; was meant to include
any method in a shader that used more information than the shaded point's and
luminaire's data. Thus any method that included shadows was a global
illumination algorithm. Whitted's paper was called a &quot;global illumination
method&quot; by most 1980s authors. However, in the late 1980s some started to use
&quot;global illumination&quot; to imply some diffuse interreflection. That latter
usage is probably more common now. However, it is a poor term in that it
leaves a gap between &quot;local illumination&quot; methods that is still used as it
was in the early 1980s, and &quot;global illumination&quot; methods. Under the usage
that includes diffuse interreflection, Whitted's or Cook's methods would be
neither local nor global. That being said, &quot;global illumination&quot; is to be
preferred over &quot;radiosity&quot;, which some game developers use to mean any method
that computes interreflection.
<P>
The Ray Tracing Algorithm. Whitted's original paper said it was &quot;a ray
tracing algorithm&quot; and discussed previous ray tracing algorithms that did not
include specular reflections and refractions. As his method became popular
there were no competitors and many authors began to refer to Whitted's
algorithm as THE ray tracing algorithm. Subsequent algorithms such as
distribution ray tracing clouded the usage.
<P>
Ray Segment. I first saw this term in Jim Hurley's writing on ray tracing. I
used the term for several years as I thought it made clear I was talking
about a single ray and not a ray tree. However, under similar logic one
should explicitly say &quot;ray tree&quot;. So what is a &quot;ray&quot;? I think we should as a
community reclaim the term &quot;ray&quot; to mean a single half-line. This will
require some discipline on our part, but the problem Jim's usage addressed
should fade if we have it.
<P>
SUGGESTED TERMS
<P>
Occlusion/Visibility. These are two opposing terms that are used
inconsistently in the literature. Either can be a boolean, scalar, or color
depending on context, and no specific aspect of that context should be
assumed when describing an operation using those terms. Most functions in
programs compute visibility (true = 1 = fully visible) in practice even when
they use opacity to describe them.
<P>
Ray Packet. This is a set of rays that are processed that the same time. The
term &quot;ray bundle&quot; is also often used. Packet is to be preferred only because
its use is somewhat more common.
<P>
Viewing/Camera Rays. These are rays from the pinhole/eye or lens area and
traced into the scene. This term has the advantage of sounding like the
viewing calculation in GPU graphics.
<P>
Radiance Rays. These return a radiance value (i.e., a color rather than a
fractional occlusion/visibility). Viewing, reflection, and refraction rays
are radiance rays while shadow and ambient occlusion rays are not.
<P>
Shadow Rays. These return an occlusion value for a point to be shaded from a
light. Without further modifiers, it should not be assumed which of a
boolean, scalar, or color value it computes.
<P>
Occlusion Rays. A more general from of shadow rays in that they are sent to
directions that may or may not include lights. Occlusion rays may return
booleans or may return some fraction. The distinction between &quot;shadow&quot; and
&quot;occlusion&quot; rays may be a bad one, as it is not clear which term is better
for sampling an HDR environment map. If one term must be chosen I would
suggest &quot;occlusion ray&quot; to encompass shadow rays.
<P>
Specular Reflection Ray. A ray that is reflected from a mirror-like surface.
There is some ambiguity on whether there is any randomness allowed in
direction. This ambiguity can be mitigated by using the expanded terms &quot;ideal
specular reflection ray&quot; and &quot;glossy specular reflection ray&quot; when needed, in
context. Because the short-hand &quot;reflection ray&quot; is sometimes used to include
diffuse as well as specular rays, it should be used only when its meaning is
clear from context.
<P>
Distribution Ray Tracing. A method that allows viewing, reflection,
refraction, and shadow rays to be randomly perturbed to implicitly sample
integrals as described by Cook. Sometimes called &quot;Cook ray tracing&quot; or
&quot;Distributed ray tracing&quot;, with the latter term to be avoided. Heckbert was
the original advocate of replacing &quot;distributed&quot; with &quot;distribution&quot; to avoid
confusion with parallel (distributed) computing, and this suggestion has been
adopted in many papers.
<P>
Path Tracing. Differs from Distribution Ray Tracing in that random rays are
traced from diffuse surfaces as well as imperfect mirrors. Also called
&quot;Kajiya ray tracing&quot; or &quot;Monte Carlo path tracing&quot;.
<P>
Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) Tree. This term is often used in ray tracing
to refer to kd-trees or particular variants of kd-trees. However, most of the
graphics communities assume that potentially non-axis-aligned dividing planes
are allowed in a BSP tree. The conventional graphics term is preferable
because we lack a term in ray tracing other than BSP trees to account for
arbitrary dividing plane orientation. Ironically I think the origin of the
ray tracing community's non-standard usage may stem from a paper I did with
Kelvin Sung called &quot;Ray tracing with the BSP tree&quot;, which used a k-d tree.
<P>
K-d Tree. This is a k-dimensional tree whose nodes divide along one of the
Cartesian axes. In practice in ray tracing k=3.
<P>
Ambient Occlusion. This is the average cosine-weighted visibility of the
background (usually the ambient occlusion is one if nothing is occluded and 0
if everything is). It is often visibility out to a point, and more generally
with a function of distance decreasing from 1 to 0 rather than a boolean. In
practice the ambient occlusion is often dampened by averaging it with a
constant.
<P>
Gather. This is an average radiance of directional samples, usually but not
always cosine-weighted samples. Unlike ambient occlusion, when a gather ray
hits a surface some illumination model such as photon mapping is evaluated
and a radiance rather than an occlusion value is returned. One suggestion is
to call this a &quot;gathering&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;scatter-gather&quot;. I think
that might be a good idea.
<P>
Surface Area Heuristic (SAH). Goldsmith and Salmon introduced a cost function
to approximate the expected time to intersect a uniformly random ray with a
set of primitives stored in a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH). They also
introduced a greedy bottom-up construction algorithm which has since not been
found to be competitive. MacDonald and Booth adapted that cost function to
k-d trees and they called their cost function the &quot;surface area heuristic&quot;.
They also introduced a greedy top-down build which took each node in
isolation and decided whether to subdivide it based on the unsubdivided SAH
and the SAH of creating exactly two new leaves (ignoring the potential for
further subdivisions). Since that time, BVHs have been shown to benefit from
this top-down greedy build as well. Although not exactly consistent with
McDonald and Booth's original paper, in practice both cost functions are
called the SAH, and this has not led to much confusion because it is usually
clear from context whether a k-d tree or BVH is being used. So it is
recommended that this practice of letting the SAH encompass a family of cost
functions continue. The top-down greedy algorithm should not be called the
SAH; rather it is a particular empirical method to let the SAH drive tree
construction.

Another Opinion of "Foundations of Multidimensional and Metric Data"</A></FONT>, by Bretton Wade (brettonwade(at)gmail(.)com)
</H4>
[This is in response to my review in <a href="rtnv20n1.html#art12">RTNv20n1</a>. --Eric]
<P>
I am a big fan of Hanan's works, his first books, &quot;design...&quot; and
&quot;applications...&quot; were among the most thumbed books on my shelf. This new
text replaces them both. It's worth noting that this is the tallest book on
my shelf by more than an inch, which required me to raise the shelf, but also
makes it easy to find!
<P>
Hanan's approach is an interesting one for the game and graphics community
because he thinks of spatial data structures as indexes into a database,
rather than thinking of them as native storage mechanisms. Among other
advantages, this enables deployment of multiple SDS-based indexes on a single
database, chosen for particular performance properties.
<P>
The Metric Data Structures book is definitely not designed for casual
reading! I like to treat it like an encyclopedia. It is so comprehensive that
it is my first source, but I need other resources to flesh out pragmatic
details. Several passes at any topic in the book with a web browser by your
side will often fill in the blanks. The companion examples on Hanan's web
page are very helpful, as well.
<P>
I would like to see subsequent editions of this book include some of the
pragmatic refinements that have been made in the fields of games and
graphics, especially in areas of leveraging coherence from frame to frame.
<P>
I don't know if you know Hanan, but if you want to have some fun, talk to him
about various spatial algorithms and the book. He's got a photographic
memory, and can tell you the page number to refer to, who invented the
algorithm, and about 5 things you wouldn't think he'd be able to recite about
any algorithm in there. It blows me away!

Bounding Volume Hierarchy Formation: Two New Ways</A></FONT>, by Eric Haines
</H4>
In the last issue, <a href="rtnv20n1.html#art8">RTNv20n1</a>, I gave two cases which are tricky for bounding
volume hierarchy (BVH) formation: pick-up sticks and a room full of dice. My
basic point was that, if you use a top-down approach with a splitting plane
and the Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) to create the BVH, you can run into
problems.
<P>
The pick-up sticks case might better be visualized as a mesh, with each long
wire as a separate object. The point here is that the first splitting plane
made could form two child boxes that are almost identical in size to the
parent box. A naive &quot;sort by the centroids and divide the objects into two
equal subsets&quot; approach will certainly fail: assuming the wires are jiggled a
bit (so that the centroids are not all perfectly aligned), then this approach
would have the effect of putting half the horizontal and half the vertical
wires in each child, so forming child boxes that are about the same size as
the parent. By any local efficiency criterion, such children are doing
nothing to improve efficiency.
<P>
A simple SAH scheme will not fare much better. Say you do a test of &quot;try a
split at each centroid and compute the efficiency&quot;, starting with the
horizontal axis. You normally compute a running total of how many objects are
to the left, right, and overlapping the test points, traversed left to right.
All the horizontal sticks will overlap all test points. So the &quot;best&quot;
centroid will split the set of sticks into about two equal sets, by this
criteria, putting about half the vertical sticks in each child, along with
some horizontal sticks in each. However, each child box formed is again about
the same size as the original bounding box, gaining you little for a single
split.
<P>
The room full of dice I probably should have called a room full of ping-pong
balls at zero G's; I meant for the room to be full of small objects in 3D,
uniformly distributed. I'll keep it &quot;dice&quot; just because &quot;dice&quot; is a shorter
term than &quot;ping-pong balls&quot;. For this case, the problem is that one of the
child bounding boxes will be the same size as the parent bounding box (as it
will include the room itself), yet will contain only half the dice (the other
half being in the other child). At each successive cut, half the remaining
dice will likely be put in one child box along with the room, and this will
continue for a number of divisions. In fact, some top-down schemes work worse
than that. For example, say you did a spatial median split strategy, where
you take the bounding box, choose the longest axis, and split in half. One
child will always include the room itself, of course. However, this child
would then have to be split again in exactly the same way, choosing the
longest axis and splitting in the same fashion, which would have no effect on
this child (all objects would land on the same side of the split, ad
infinitum). I think there's an interesting area for improvement, that if an
object is intersected by the &quot;best&quot; plane and is larger than some value
(e.g., some ratio of the child's surface area vs. the object's), it should
immediately be separated out to its own box rather than be forced into a
child.
<P>
Long and short, top down algorithms can have problems doing the right thing
in some cases. If you were to form BVHs by hand, for the wires case you would
certainly put all the horizontal wires together in one child and the vertical
in the other; for dice you would separate the room from the dice and then
subdivide on the dice. Current top-down algorithms forming BVHs tend to treat
objects by their centroids and have little sense of grouping by size or shape.
<P>
Being an inveterate efficiency scheme guy, what most interested me at RT '08
were two papers: &quot;Fast Agglomerative Clustering for Rendering&quot;, by Bruce
Walter, Kavita Bala, Milind Kulkarni, and Keshav Pingali, and &quot;Tree Rotations
for Improving Bounding Volume Hierarchies&quot;, by Andrew Kensler. Both can be
found at <A HREF="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2008Papers.htm">http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2008Papers.htm</A>.
<P>
Bruce's (et alia's - I'm going to leave the &quot;et al&quot;s off from here on in)
scheme is bottom-up. It's slower than most top-down methods, but it can be
made pretty efficient. The basic idea is for each object to find, of all the
other objects in the scene, that one which is its &quot;best match&quot;. A best
matching object for a given object is one that would minimize the
intersection cost the most if the two objects were put in a tight bounding
box. On an intuitive level, imagine the pick-up sticks case. Each vertical
stick would note that its best object to pair with was another nearby stick,
to the right or left of it, since putting two neighboring sticks in the same
box would be a win. Same with the horizontal sticks, each points to the stick
it pairs up with best. For example, imagine three vertical sticks:
<P>
<PRE>
A      B   C
|      |   |
|      |   |
|      |   |
|      |   |
|      |   |
</PRE>
<P>
Stick A would point to B, B would point to C, C to B, as the best matches.
Since B points to C and C to B, these would form a good pair and be put in a
parent box. This parent box may affect the graph, i.e. anything pointing at
it may decide the resulting box is now too big to be a best match and so
another match should be found. After each merge the graph is checked again
and the best pair (objects that point to each other) are put in a parent box,
the graph updated, and the process repeats. For our simple example the
hierarchy would be:
<P>
<PRE>
      box
       |
    +-----+
    A    box
          |
        +---+
        B   C
</PRE>
<P>
A trivial example, but this has a pretty logical feel to it: nearby objects
get paired up as best as possible, the results get folded back into pairing,
and eventually you get a BVH. The paper gives a number of techniques to speed
up the search for best matches. The results show the agglomerative method is
generally superior to a top-down scheme: the theoretical expected cost of a
random ray is up to 30 0.000000e+000ss, and actual timings (though not quite as good)
also show up to a 30avings. The top-down scheme used is Wald's fast
binning scheme from IRT'07, which is not really optimal (better is Wald's BVH
scheme for their animation paper, which I'll briefly describe below). Still,
the sense is that agglomerative BVH formation gives higher efficiency trees.
For the pick-up sticks and dice room cases this algorithm should work pretty
well. Certainly the vertical sticks will pair up with their neighbors, the
horizontals with theirs, until each set is in a separate topmost box, with
these two topmost boxes then getting bound into one root box. The dice will
also pair with each other, until the sum of the dice then pairs with the room
itself at the top of the tree.
<P>
I am sure local greediness causing inefficiencies, however. Imagine you have
vertical sticks A B C D, left to right, at <I>almost</I> regular intervals. B and
C happen to be slightly closer to each other than their neighbors, so they
get paired first. Then A or D will get paired with BC's box, then the
remaining single object (D or A) would get paired to this cluster of three.
Better would be for A and B to pair up, C and D to pair up, then the two
parent boxes pair up. This is a more balanced tree and will be more
efficient. The greedy, localized nature of the algorithm gives a less optimal
result in this case.
<P>
Kensler's paper gives a clever idea: after forming your bounding volume
hierarchy using whatever method you like, try to do local swaps (tree
rotations) that improve your overall theoretical average tree traversal cost.
It's easiest to just look at figures 1 and 2 in the paper:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~aek/research/tree.pdf">http://www.cs.utah.edu/~aek/research/tree.pdf</A>. Doing so, he gets at best a
10 0ecrease in cost after a number of iterations. More interesting yet, he
uses simulated annealing to essentially first jumble the tree a fair bit
(allowing locally-inefficient swaps) and get it out of a potentially local
minimum, then iteratively apply effective rotations to a minimum, jumble a
bit less, iterate, and so on. This gets a decrease as much as an 18 0ecrease
in SAH theoretical cost (in terms of empirical results, most times improved
but occasionally some test case would take longer - I can entirely empathize
with this sort of thing, where the theoretical result improves but actual
performance worsens).
<P>
I was happy to see someone using the idea of simulated annealing for this
purpose. This idea was floated by Jim Arvo twenty years ago, in <a href="rtnews1b.html">the second
issue of the Ray Tracing News</a>. Arvo thought in more general terms, where you
could use entirely different efficiency schemes (grids, BVHs, octrees) at
different parts of the hierarchy, varying these to find an optimal hierarchy
of efficiency schemes. Kensler's approach is easier to imagine and control,
and appears to give good results.
<P>
Though Kensler's results are not as strong as Walter's on the face of it
(purely by statistics), Kensler starts with Wald et alia's more effective BVH
scheme, from:
<P>
<PRE>
    I. Wald, S. Boulos, and P. Shirley. Ray Tracing Deformable Scenes using
    Dynamic Bounding Volume Hierarchies. ACM Transactions on Graphics,
    26(1):118, 2007.
</PRE>
<P>
This method is as follows: objects are sorted by centroid, with centroids
essentially marking split locations. For forming BVHs there's no real
splitting plane, you just separate the set into two sets and bound each,
using these children bounding box areas to determine the effectiveness of the
split. The (simplified) cost function is each child box's surface area times
the number of objects in the box, summed together. However, if you were to
check each pair of sets separately, you'd have to recompute the bounds for
each set from scratch. The clever bit is to walk the list of objects
backwards and compute a running bounding box for each object added, then run
forwards through the same list and also compute a running bounding box. Then
at any given split you have two bounding boxes (one stored from the backwards
run, one computed on the fly from the forwards run) and can see how effective
the split will be.
<P>
An example will make this clearer. Say you have five objects, A through E.
You will test all three axes as follows: sort the objects by their centroid
locations. Say the order for one axis is C E A D B. First traverse this list
right to left. So, at B, you start with the bounding box for B and store its
surface area for B. You visit D, adding it to the bounding box for B, and
computing and storing the surface area for this object. You add A to the
bounding box for DB, compute area and store for that location, all the way
back to C. Now traversing left to right, you start with the bounding box for
C and compute its surface area. The cost function, if you were to split the
set into two sets {C} and {E,A,D,B}, would be 1*C's area plus 4*EADB's area.
The &quot;1&quot; is for one child, C, the &quot;4&quot; for 4 children, EADB. By going right to
left initially and storing the area of the accumulated right-side bounding
box, you have the area for EADB stored. Moving to object E, you compute the
running bounding box for CE, get its area, then compute 2*CE's area + 3*ADB's
area. Again, ADB's area was computed by the right to left sweep and stored.
In this way, you'll find an accurate &quot;best&quot; cost for the sorted list by just
two passes through this list. It's only locally optimal, and only for that
particular ordering of the list, but this scheme works better than an
SAH-based splitting plane that essentially gives up on objects that are split
by a plane test at each centroid by counting them as being in both boxes.
<P>
What is great about this scheme is that it actually does better with the
pick-up sticks problem than other top-down methods. What it will do for this
case is find the centroid where all the horizontal sticks are in one child
(and most of the vertical sticks), and the other child has just the remainder
of the vertical sticks (those to the far side of the centroids of the
horizontal sticks). The child with the horizontal sticks will not be any
smaller than the parent (or not much), but the child with just the vertical
sticks will definitely be smaller and therefore effective. There is some
waste, but at least the first split does something useful, vs. &quot;just split it
down the middle&quot;, which creates two children boxes the same size as the
parent.
<P>
The room of dice doesn't perform better on the first split than a naive
splitter - it turns out that splitting down the middle is what Wald's scheme
would also likely give. For example, given a room full of dice (&quot;*&quot; are the
dice):
<P>
<PRE>
   +----------+
   |**********|
   |**********|
   |**********|
   |**********|
   +----------+
</PRE>
<P>
After one split:
<P>
<PRE>
      child 1           child 2
   +----------+
   |*****     |          *****
   |*****     |          *****
   |*****     |          *****
   |*****     |          *****
   +----------+
</PRE>
<P>
there are two children, one with the room and half the dice, the other with
the other half of the dice. All the top-down methods I know, simple or
clever, will give something like this. When this half-full room on the left
is divided by SAH splitting, all potential split planes hit the room, so its
effect on the cost function is nullified. That means that basic SAH testing
would split the dice in the left child into two sets, with the room again
added to one of these sets. This halving process will go on quite awhile,
with the room never being separated from some remaining dice, since the room
itself is ignored by an pure SAH-split cost function.
<P>
What we'd really like is for the room to be removed entirely from further
dice testing, the sooner the better. This is where Wald's scheme excels.
Sorting child 1's objects on a horizontal axis will result in the room itself
being the rightmost object, since its centroid is to the right of all the
remaining dice. The optimal split will turn out to be just where you would
want it: the resulting left subchild gets all the remaining dice, the right
subchild gets the room. This happens because the room's bounding box is
accounted for correctly in the cost function computations. After this second
split the room has been removed from the dice and the pathological case is
solved. It might have been nicer to first separate out the room entirely from
all the dice at the first split, but Wald's scheme gets you there in two
splits instead of one. Anyway, this scheme is the baseline that Andrew
Kensler used for his research, and it seems like a pretty good starting spot
(the best I currently know, at least).
<P>
I asked Andrew Kensler and Bruce Walter how they thought their schemes would
handle these two potentially-nasty cases. My secret agenda was to have them
collaborate on a paper, where Bruce would first form an agglomerative
hierarchy, and Andrew would do simulated annealing on the result to see how
much, if any, it would improve it further. Unfortunately, my nefarious
puppetmaster skills haven't yielded any results yet, as far as I know.
However, I did get interesting replies and a continued conversation with them
both. Quite a bit was said, but I'll try to just sum up the high points.
<P>
First, Bruce believes his scheme would do pretty well with both pathological
cases, which I also expect would be the case. Not optimally (as noted by the
A B C D pick-up sticks problem earlier), but it would avoid the top of the
tree being poorly formed, for the most part. Andrew, impressively enough,
actually ran some tests. First, he found out that Wald's scheme worked pretty
well in solving the pathologicals from the get-go, in the process making me
go learn about Wald's scheme (it's buried in some pseudo-code in Wald's
paper, not really described, which is one reason I explained it here). I had
read through Wald's paper, but never spent time grokking the pseudo-code.
Second, he found that his tree swapping scheme indeed worked as expected: the
room for the room full of dice would indeed percolate up the bounding volume
hierarchy until it stood alone by itself, near the root.
<P>
This being a text-and-ASCII-art kind of publication (it makes my life
simple), I can't show you the cool visualizations he made of the test
hierarchies, but they're a pretty nice way to visualize bounding boxes in a
schematic tree, making the node radius log-proportional to the size of the
box and using node color to show which axis (XYZ == RGB) of the box was the
longest.
<P>
It's great to see serious progress these past few years on forming better
BVHs. There's also been work (such as Wald's RT'07 paper, see
<A HREF="http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2007Papers.htm">http://kesen.huang.googlepages.com/rt2007Papers.htm</A>) about how to form better
BVHs rapidly, which is also quite useful. Me, I'd like to know how much more
could be squeezed out of BVHs formed by these various methods. My guess is,
not much, that we're pretty close to the optimal solution, at least optimal
as judged by our efficiency equations. The next task is then to tune the
efficiency equation, if possible, so that it better mirrors how well the
hierarchy does in practice.

NVIDIA Ray Tracing Demo</A></FONT>, by Steven Parker (sparker(at)nvidia(.)com) and David Luebke (dluebke(at)nvidia(.)com)
</H4>
At SIGGRAPH 2008 NVIDIA showed a demo of a ray tracer running on 4 Quadro
GPUs that was written by members of NVIDIA Research and the NVIDIA NVSG
(NVIDIA Scene Graph) teams. The ray tracer was written entirely in CUDA and
has fully programmable shading including bump maps, IBL car paint, and
spatially varying ambient. The city scene was composed of purchased models,
assembled/tweaked in Maya, exported through COLLADA, and driven through NVSG.
The approximately two million triangles were split roughly evenly between car
and the city scene. The scene included locally adaptive supersampling for
antialiasing, ray traced shadows, reflection, and refraction with a maximum
of three bounces. Dynamically updated BVHs were used for the acceleration
structure, and 15-30 Hz was reached at 1080p. The main technical challenge
was dealing with up to 30k threads in flight on each GT200. This demands
minimizing on-chip thread state, which was achieved using a short stack.
There is one ray tree per thread and explicitly managed recursion. The load
balancing was static between GPUs, and dynamic within each GPU.
<P>
This exercise was a test of the software/hardware capabilities of current
GPUs to deal with the irregular computational loads caused by ray tracing
with programmable shaders. The results were good enough to indicate that the
basic techniques could be used in current applications, and we're now working
on getting these techniques into the field.

[Graham read the article on ray/box optimization in <a href="rtnv19n1.html#art7">RTNv19n1</a>, then optimized

was optimal. I'd still like to know if his code is optimal with the Intel

<P>
I took out the swaps and unrolled the loops as you suggested, and did see an
improvement of about 8%. Then I added the sign indexing trick to my ray
structure, which got an additional improvement. Here's where things got
weird, which I presume is due to the architecture (latest Xeon). After
testing various orderings of the exit tests and floating point computations,
I took the &quot;no swaps&quot; idea to the logical conclusion, basically expanding out
all the possible exit cases, and putting all the exit tests after all the
floating point computations. The result was a full 70 0.000000aster than my
original code on my scenes. I can only guess that the processor is still
working on the floating point stuff when it starts to perform the tests, and
somehow benefits from that. Processors are so unpredictable these days. [Look
for the Abrash article mentioned elsewhere in this issue. -- Eric]

The order of the exit testing did matter, I presume because we want to test

intrinsic functions enabled, &quot;favor fast code&quot;, &quot;precise&quot; floating point

<P>
I did try moving the early outs to earlier places, but I found on my tests
that if I put any of the tests above any of the floating point stuff, it did
get slower. I tried quite a few permutations there. That being said, there
might be some permutation that I did not try. Looking at the ASM listing, it
looks as if the compiler has decided on its own that some of the early-outs
should be placed between the various floating point operations. I don't think
it's actually doing any SSE2 code though. Maybe the Intel compiler would do
even better.

Radians versus Degrees</A></FONT>, by Eric Haines
</H4>
I work in CAD, and was comparing notes with other people about whether it's
better to store numbers as degrees or radians. I suspect the real answer is,
as usual, &quot;it depends&quot;. I was finding a number of people were of the opinion
that radians was the obvious way to go. The main argument is that the radian
is used for the inputs and outputs of various trigonometric functions in C.
Anyway, I thought I'd give my take on the issue: degrees. One argument is
that they do work perfectly for many commonly-used angles. Also, multiply 360
degrees by 20 revolutions and you get a precise answer; multiply 2*PI*20 and
good luck to you.

    Sure, you can use a calculator to translate to and from your favorite
    angle units, but it doesn't lend itself to readable code. As a user,
    I'd rather see &quot;90&quot; than &quot;1.5707963267948499&quot;. The point is moot if no
    user is ever going to look at or edit the model directly with a text
    editor, but if there's some possibility that they might, why make it
    hard for no reason?

    That is, if you write out an XML file with angles, would you prefer
    &quot;angle=1.5707963267948499&quot; or &quot;angle=90&quot;?

    XML is supposed to be human readable and editable (and debuggable), by
    hand if need be; its one of the reasons we pay the price of a bulky
    string-based file format vs. a binary format.

Have you tried Marsaglia's complementary-multiply-with-carry (the code is

John Stone replies:
<P>
I've been playing with Marsaglia's KISS RNG which is a combination of the MWC
RNG and two other RNGs. I've been pretty happy with that one so far. It does
reasonably well on the statistics tests and runs pretty fast. I haven't tried
MWC by itself, as I focused on RNGs that had a bit longer period and better
stats. The xorshift RNGs are quite interesting, particularly for use on GPUs
since GPUs can do bit shift operations inexpensively but don't like to do
full 32-bit integer multiplies (at least on present-day hardware). I haven't
gotten very far on checking into the really recent xorshift RNGs that
supposedly have statistics about as good as MT based on L'Ecuyer's testing. I
want to take some of the better RNGs from L'Ecuyer's TESTU01 suite and try
implementing them on both GPUs and for multithreaded implementation on CPUs
and see how they do. I just haven't had time to work on it yet.
<P>

Pretty interesting, thanks for the L'Ecuyer pointer. I grabbed TestU01 and
looked in there; I don't see the generator I mentioned (&quot;Complimentary
multiply-with-carry&quot; from George Marsaglia, &quot;Seeds for Random Number
Generators&quot;, Communications of the ACM, May 2003, Vol 46 No 5, pp90-93). I
plugged it into TestU01 and it passes L'Ecuyer's SmallCrush and Crush
batteries (BigCrush is still running). I used the 8-seed version with period
~= 2^285. Timing-wise it's slightly slower than KISS99 on my machine (it has
only one 32x32-&gt;64 multiply, but has a conditional and a bigger state table).
<P>
I don't know if that is relevant to you. Complementary multiply-with-carry
seems a little obscure for some reason but it seems to have very good
properties.
<P>
I asked John for any final followup. He replied:

The main observation that I've had recently is simply that it would be very
nice to have a toolbox of RNGs that work well on GPU architectures, i.e.
many-core architectures where the stack doesn't exist, local/cache memories
are very small (KBytes at most) and most of one's active data lives in
registers. My previous commentary about the excessive resources used by some
of the traditionally popular high-quality RNGs goes doubly so in the case of
GPUs and similar many-core architectures. Some of the simpler RNGs that were
mentioned in <a href="rtnv20n1.html#art10">the previous RTNews article</a> and subsequent discussions are
viable for GPUs. That said, one often needs to create parallel random number
streams that are uncorrelated, and that looks to be much harder to do well
for the RNGs I'm familiar with, particularly at the scale one needs if one
wants a separate RNG per-thread on a GPU-like many-core architecture that
schedules tens of thousands of threads concurrently. RNGs can end up being a
bottleneck for Monte Carlo algorithms on architectures like GPUs, if they
reduce available parallelism or create the necessity to perform frequent
reductions or other operations involving warp-wide or thread-block-wide
synchronization.
<P>
I would love to see someone do some significant exploration in the
implementation of high quality RNGs on GPUs. Particularly interesting is to
find RNGs with a decent period, small state vector, and the ability to
generated uncorrelated streams, all within the confines of a single thread
such that the RNG can be used in thousands of independent threads of
execution. This would have lots of uses in graphics and ray tracing in
particular, but also for lots of scientific computing applications as well.

Subconscious Debugging</A></FONT>, by Ian Ashdown (ian_ashdown(at)helios32(.)com)
</H4>
Having been a software engineer for the past thirty years, I have always been
fascinated by how the human mind tackles difficult debugging problems. For
me, such problems are akin to freeform chess, where the number of variables
and possible execution paths can far exceed the capacity of the conscious
mind to assimilate. I often feel that debugging requires a partnership
between the conscious and subconscious mind.
<P>
This thought was reinforced recently when I had a particularly difficult
problem involving ray tracing. It was not that the problem itself was overly
complicated, but that the number of possible causes was overwhelming.
<P>
Problems like this occasionally intrude upon my dreams as nightmares, but the
dream I experienced while waking up from a restless night was particularly
vivid.
<P>
I dreamt I was standing on a mountaintop overlooking a desert. It was sunny
and brutally hot, I was wearing nothing but an itchy robe (the housecoat I
usually wear after taking a shower), and my bare feet were sore from standing
on the hot rocks. Worse, my arms were sore from holding this block of stone
in the shape of an open book.
<P>
Yes, I know, Moses and all that ... after five decades, I was dreaming about
my Sunday school lessons from the Bible. I even recognized this in my dream
and was about to tell myself to wake up when I realized that there was C++
source code on the stone (hey, it was my dream), and that one line was
burning. A thundering voice shouted &quot;Badouel!!!,&quot; which woke me up.
<P>
Ten minutes later I was holding my heavy 800+ page copy of Graphics Gems,
looking at the page with Didier Badouels pseudocode for his ray-triangle
intersection algorithm (&quot;An Efficient Ray-Polygon Intersection&quot;). And there
on the right-hand page, right where I saw it in my dream, was the line of
code that was causing the problem in my program.
<P>
I had not looked at Badouels algorithm in this book since 1993. Fifteen
years ago!
<P>
One hour later, my problem was solved, and I had a new explanation for
sleeping at my desk: &quot;Let me tell you a story...&quot;
